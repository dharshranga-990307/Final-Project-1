# Final-Project-1

Image Classification Using Convolutional  NeuralNetworks



Objective- The Main Objective is to build a convolutional neural network to classify the images.

Dataset Used- MNIST Dataset

Process-

Dataset Loading and Exploration- To load the Dataset,display a sample image.

Data Preprocessing -Normalising the images and data augmentation.

Build the CNN Model

Train the Model

Evaluate the Model- Based on the test dataset(Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, Binary Cross Entropy Loss)
